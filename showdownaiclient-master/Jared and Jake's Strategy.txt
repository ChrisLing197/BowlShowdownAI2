Strategic weights:

-As soon as an action starts a deterministic victory possiblity, taking that action or actions that improve win likelihood (scouting all opposing moves and pokemon, removing need for prediction, removing need for accuracy checks, etc.)

-Not fainting

-Getting rid of threats
	-Making opposing pokemon faint
	-Making opposing pokemon less threatening (burn, para, tricked items, taunt, confusion, etc.)

-Not revealing information

-Forcing opponents to reveal information (through threat, or through phazing)

-Setting up
	-Getting rid of counters and checks
	-Boosting stats for sweep
	-Saving at least one sweeper (esp. without reveal) until its counters and checks have been removed

-Saving counters and checks for threats

-Getting free turns (Substitute blocking, Taunt, Phazing a switch, Spore, Foddering, etc.)

-Investing in future damage (hazards, toxic, etc.)

-PP

-Playing to outs (if an unlikely event is needed for victory, make the play that makes victory possible)




Suggestion:
Three modes of operation, one for normal gameplay, one for possible win-scenarios, and one for possible lose-scenarios
-Regular does not need to calculate win likelihood or lose likelihood
-Win-scenarios only calculates win likelihood, offset by lose likelihood
-Lose-scenarios only calculate lose likelihood, offset by win likelihood
