Strategic weights:

-Not fainting

-Getting rid of threats
	-Making opposing pokemon faint
	-Making opposing pokemon less threatening (burn, para, tricked items, taunt, confusion, etc.)

-Not revealing information

-Forcing opponents to reveal information (through threat, or through phazing)

-Setting up
	-Getting rid of counters and checks
	-Boosting stats for sweep
	-Saving at least one sweeper (esp. without reveal) until its counters and checks have been removed

-Saving counters and checks for threats

-Getting free turns (Substitute blocking, Taunt, Phazing a switch, Spore, Foddering, etc.)

-Investing in future damage (hazards, toxic, etc.)

-PP

-Playing to outs (if an unlikely event is needed for victory, make the play that makes victory possible)
